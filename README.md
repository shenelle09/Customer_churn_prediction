Predicting customer churn in the banking sector is crucial for multiple reasons. High churn rates can disrupt the stability and growth of a bank, hindering its ability to thrive in a competitive industry. By focusing on retention, banks reduce customer acquisition costs, improve customer satisfaction, and make informed, data-driven decisions. This approach also enables the implementation of targeted retention strategies, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and fostering customer advocacy, which positively impacts the bank's reputation.
